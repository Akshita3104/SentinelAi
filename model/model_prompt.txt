Build a Python-based DDoS detection system for SDN network slicing using machine learning. The system will analyze network flows in real-time to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks within different network slices.

### Model Details:
- Multiple ML algorithms for DDoS detection:
  - Random Forest
  - Decision Trees
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - Support Vector Machine
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression

### Input Features:
- Flow statistics:
  - Source/Destination IP and Port
  - Protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)
  - Packet count and byte count
  - Flow duration
  - Packets/bytes per second
  - Slice identifier

### API:
- `POST /detect`
  - Input: Flow statistics in JSON format
  - Output: DDoS detection result with confidence score

### Key Components:
1. **Flow Collector**: Captures flow statistics from SDN switches
2. **Feature Extractor**: Processes raw flow data into ML features
3. **Model Trainer**: Handles model training and evaluation
4. **DDoS Detector**: Real-time detection of DDoS attacks
5. **Mitigation Module**: Implements slice-aware mitigation strategies

### Features:
- Real-time flow analysis
- Multiple ML models for detection
- Slice-aware DDoS mitigation
- Performance metrics and logging
- REST API for integration with SDN controller

### Integration:
- Works with RYU SDN controller
- Supports OpenFlow 1.3+
- Can be extended with custom detection rules
