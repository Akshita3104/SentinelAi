Create a responsive React.js frontend for a project titled "SENTINEL.AI-5G". The interface should serve as a real-time security dashboard for a 5G network slice management system. The dashboard must include:

1. **Slice Health Visualization**:
   - Status indicator for each slice (Green = Normal, Red = Compromised, Yellow = Healing)
   - Use WebSocket or polling to fetch live status every 3 seconds
   - Slices: eMBB, URLLC, IoT

2. **Anomaly Alert Timeline**:
   - Chronological list of anomaly events detected by the AI
   - Includes timestamp, slice ID, anomaly score, action taken

3. **Traffic Statistics**:
   - Use Chart.js or Recharts to show:
     - Real-time packet rate per slice
     - Bandwidth usage
     - Anomaly detection frequency

4. **Container Monitoring**:
   - Show Docker container status (running/stopped/restarting)
   - Include restart count and recovery status

5. **Manual Attack Simulation Panel**:
   - Button triggers dummy attack (calls backend API)
   - Dropdown to select which slice to attack

Design the UI with modern, minimal components using Tailwind CSS. Use React Query or Axios for all API calls. Ensure clear component separation and responsiveness.

APIs to connect to:
- `/api/slice-status`
- `/api/traffic-stats`
- `/api/anomaly-events`
- `/api/container-health`
- `/api/simulate-attack?slice=`

Use dummy data structures for initial state; real-time data will be populated by the backend.
